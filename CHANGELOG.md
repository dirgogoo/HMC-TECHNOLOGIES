## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-29

### üö® BREAKING CHANGE: Direct Installation Model

**Complete restructuring from marketplace-based to direct user installation.**

This is a **major breaking change** - the entire installation model has changed. Users must uninstall v2.x and reinstall v3.0.

#### Migration Path

**From v2.x (Marketplace)**:
```bash
# Old installation (no longer supported)
/plugin marketplace add dirgogoo/HMC-TECHNOLOGIES
```

**To v3.0 (Direct Installation)**:
```bash
# New installation
git clone https://github.com/dirgogoo/HMC-TECHNOLOGIES.git
cd HMC-TECHNOLOGIES
./install.sh
```

### Added

- **install.sh** - Automated installer with backup support
- **uninstall.sh** - Clean uninstaller with user data backup
- **README.md** - Completely rewritten for direct installation
- **.gitignore** - Ignore user-generated data directories

### Changed

- **Installation Model**: Marketplace ‚Üí Direct `~/.claude/` installation
- **Repository Focus**: From marketplace container to installable system
- **config/defaults.yml**: Updated repository URL to reflect new structure
- **Version**: Bumped to 3.0.0 to reflect breaking changes

### Removed

- **.claude-plugin/** directory - No longer marketplace-based
- **marketplace.json** - Not needed for direct installation
- **plugin.json** - Not needed for direct installation
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Will be recreated if needed
- **lib/** - Empty directory removed

### Why This Change?

The marketplace model added unnecessary complexity:
- Users faced installation errors (plugin not found, schema issues)
- Cache conflicts between versions
- Dependency on Claude Code marketplace infrastructure
- Limited control over installation location

**Direct installation benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Complete control - install once, use forever
- ‚úÖ No marketplace dependencies
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging - files visible in `~/.claude/`
- ‚úÖ Simpler updates - just `git pull` and reinstall
- ‚úÖ Better backup - direct access to user data
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform - works anywhere Claude Code runs
